"""Citation evaluation detectors and scoring functions.

This module implements simplified versions of claim detection and
citation quality checks. In the full HELMSMAN system these would
interface with advanced fact checking services (TruthLens) to assess
support, contradiction and coverage. Here we use naive heuristics to
determine whether a response contains factual claims and whether the
provided citations meet the minimum count and independence requirements.
